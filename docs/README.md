# Convirgance

Convirgance gives you the power of SQL with the flexibility of modern data processing. It's designed for developers who want direct control over their database operations without the overhead of traditional ORMs.

## Why Convirgance?

Traditional ORMs force you to map your database to Java objects, adding complexity and overhead. Convirgance takes a different approach:

- **Direct SQL Control**: Write the SQL you want, get back the data you need
- **Stream Processing**: Handle large datasets efficiently without loading everything into memory
- **Format Freedom**: Read from a database, output to CSV, or transform JSON - it's all the same to Convirgance
- **SQL-Like Operations**: Use familiar concepts like WHERE clauses and GROUP BY, even on non-SQL data sources

## Quick Example

Here's how simple it is to query a database and transform the results:

```java
// Query your database
DBMS database = new DBMS(source);
Query query = new Query("select * from CUSTOMER");
Iterable<JSONObject> results = database.query(query);

for(JSONObject record : results.iterator())
{
  System.out.println(record.toString(4));
}

// Output to CSV
CSVOutput output = new CSVOutput();
output.write(target, results);
```

```java
/*
  The contents of `results`
  {"ORDER_ID":1,"TOTAL":54.12,"ITEMS":3,"RECIPIENT":"bob","LINE_ID":1,"PRODUCT":"Fish tank","PRICE":30.00,"QUANTITY":1}
  {"ORDER_ID":1,"TOTAL":54.12,"ITEMS":3,"RECIPIENT":"bob","LINE_ID":2,"PRODUCT":"Fish food","PRICE":4.00,"QUANTITY":3}
*/
String[] fields = new String[]
{
    "ORDER_ID", "RECIPIENT", "TOTAL", "ITEMS"
};
SortedGroupByTransformer sorter = new SortedGroupByTransformer(fields, "lines");
Iterable<JSONObject> customerData = sorter.transform(results)

/*
The transformer would return the following. In comparison to what the database returned this output is much more concise. Also notice that the duplicate fields were removed.
  {
    "RECIPIENT": "bob",
    "TOTAL": 42,
    "ORDER_ID": 1,
    "ITEMS": 2,
    "lines": [
      {
        "LINE_ID": 1,
        "PRODUCT": "Fish tank",
        "PRICE": 30,
        "QUANTITY": 1
      },
      {
        "LINE_ID": 2,
        "PRODUCT": "Fish food",
        "PRICE": 4,
        "QUANTITY": 3
      }
    ]
  }
*/
```

## Getting Started

Ready to dive in? Here's what you need to know:

1. [Getting Started Guide](getting-started.md) - Installation and your first Convirgance application
2. [Database Operations](database-operations.md) - Working with databases efficiently
3. [Filtering Data](filtering-data.md) - SQL-like operations for any data source
4. [Transforming Data](transforming-data.md) - Reshape and enrich your data
5. [File Formats](file-formats.md) - Working with CSV, JSON, and more

## Core Concepts

### Database Operations

Handle database interactions with confidence. Atomic operations ensure your transactions succeed or fail cleanly, while batch processing keeps things fast.

### Filters

Apply SQL-like conditions to any data source. Combine filters with AND/OR operations just like you would in a WHERE clause.

### Transformations

Build data pipelines that clean and reshape your data. Convert types, group records, or compute new fields - all without loading everything into memory.

### File Formats

Work with data in any format. Read from CSV, transform in memory, write to JSON - all using the same consistent API.

## Installation

Using Maven add the following to your `pom` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.invirgance</groupId>
    <artifactId>convirgance</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Or use the CLI:

```sh
mvn dependency:get -Dartifact=com.invirgance:convirgance:1.0.0
```

# Convirgance

Convirgance is a high-performance application platform built upon the Java ecosystem 
and engineered with a Data Oriented Design (DOD) architecture for speed, scalability, 
and efficiency. It supports workloads ranging from high-throughput database pipelines 
to low-latency AI-powered services. All with a fraction of the code required by 
traditional stacks.

Because it runs on the Java platform, Convirgance benefits from decades of ecosystem
maturity, proven stability, and battle-tested performance. Applications start in 
milliseconds, use minimal runtime resources and scale better than even Node.js 
microservices. The architecture cleanly separates code from data, allowing 
applications to be snapped together like legos. No boilerplate required.

The design uses static typing to ensure components snap together correctly
and dynamic typing to maintain integrity as data flows through its transformation 
pipeline. This keeps processing flexible and lightweight, minimizes development 
overhead, and delivers the reliability, maintainability, and performance of the 
Java platform.

## Platform

The Convirgance Platform is a cohesive set of APIs and components that layer together to 
deliver high-performance application services, from raw data streaming to AI-driven web 
applications. Each layer builds on the one below it, so you can adopt just what you need 
or use the full stack for maximum productivity.

- **Convirgance (Core)** - High-speed data streaming APIs form the basis of the platform
- **Convirgance (Wiring)** - An XML-based configuration system for rapidly connecting Java objects into cohesive applications such as REST services 
- **Convirgance (Web Services)** - Lightweight, Jakarta EE components for building scalable web services using Wiring files. Includes an integrated JSP tag library for creating hypermedia-driven applications (HDA) alongside JSON services.
- **Convirgance (AI Services)** - Ready-to-use components for building agentic applications on top of common AI engines *(coming soon)*
- **Convirgance (JDBC)** - Automatically retrieves JDBC drivers from Maven Central alongside apis for exploring database metadata
- **Convirgance (OLAP)** - Components for dynamically querying multidimensional datasets in OLAP structures such as Star Schemas

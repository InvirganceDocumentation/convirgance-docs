# Convirgance

Convirgance is a modern, streamlined approach to database access. Unlike traditional 
ORM frameworks that map your database into Java objects, Convirgance gives you direct 
control over your SQL queries, returning results as a stream of `Map` objects.  


Not only does this reduce coding by as much as 60%, the stream of data can
be transformed, filtered, and manipulated before being serialized to nearly
any data format. Web Services, ETL, configuration databases, OLAP, and many other
use cases can be completed in minutes rather than hours or even days.

## Why Convirgance?

Traditional ORMs force you to map your database to Java objects, adding complexity and overhead. Convirgance takes a different approach:

- **Direct SQL Queries**: No need to write Data Access Objects. Write or generate the SQL you want to get back the data you need.
- **Stream Processing**: Handle large datasets in small memory footprints without GC pauses, cache thrashing, or memory pressure.
- **Format Freedom**: Read from a database, output to CSV, or transform JSON - streams can be read from any format and written to any format.
- **SQL-Like Operations**: Filters and transformers provide advanced concepts like WHERE-clause and GROUP BY features, allowing powerful manipulation of data.
- **High Performance**: SQL queries produce better query plans, data streams have lower latency, and CPU cache utilization is higher.

## Simple Example

Here are a few examples showcasing the simplicity convirgance offers:

### Database to CSV

In this example we are taking the query `results` and writing out the contents to a CSV in only a few lines of code.

```java
// Query your database
DBMS database = new DBMS(source);
Query query = new Query("select name, devices, pets from CUSTOMER");
Iterable<JSONObject> results = database.query(query);

File file = new File("example.csv");
FileTarget target = new FileTarget(file);

// Write the stream to a CSV file
new CSVOutput().write(target, results);
```

The resulting `example.csv` file can be opened in a program like Excel to see
the exported data:

| name | devices | pets |
|------|---------|------|
| John | 3       | 1    |
| Bob  | 1       | 2    |
| Kyle | 1       | 10   |
| ...  | ...     | ...  |


### Filtering Database results

Deduplicating the results from a join query between two tables.

```java
DBMS database = new DBMS(source);
Query query = new Query("SELECT * FROM \"orders\" o\n"
                + "JOIN order_line l ON l.order_id = o.order_id "
                + "order by o.order_id, l.line_id");

Iterable<JSONObject> results = dbms.query(query);

/*
  The contents of `results`
  {"ORDER_ID":1,"TOTAL":54.12,"ITEMS":3,"RECIPIENT":"bob","LINE_ID":1,"PRODUCT":"Fish tank","PRICE":30.00,"QUANTITY":1}
  {"ORDER_ID":1,"TOTAL":54.12,"ITEMS":3,"RECIPIENT":"bob","LINE_ID":2,"PRODUCT":"Fish food","PRICE":4.00,"QUANTITY":3}
*/
String[] fields = new String[]
{
    "ORDER_ID", "RECIPIENT", "TOTAL", "ITEMS"
};
SortedGroupByTransformer sorter = new SortedGroupByTransformer(fields, "lines");
Iterable<JSONObject> customerData = sorter.transform(results)

/*
The transformer would return the following. In comparison to what the database returned this output is much more concise. Also notice that the duplicate fields were removed.
  {
    "RECIPIENT": "bob",
    "TOTAL": 42,
    "ORDER_ID": 1,
    "ITEMS": 2,
    "lines": [
      {
        "LINE_ID": 1,
        "PRODUCT": "Fish tank",
        "PRICE": 30,
        "QUANTITY": 1
      },
      {
        "LINE_ID": 2,
        "PRODUCT": "Fish food",
        "PRICE": 4,
        "QUANTITY": 3
      }
    ]
  }
*/
```

# Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)

As businesses grow and expand, they gain useful analytical data about 
their own customers and the market itself. Online Analytical Processing, or OLAP, 
provides a means of sythesizing this data into useful measures to provide business intelligence insights.

Convirgance (OLAP) provides an easy and intuitive
way to build OLAP tools around Star Schemas to produce SQL queries and perform 
data analysis to aid businesses intelligence, without the need for expensive
outsourcing.

A star schema is a type of multidimensional database design commonly used in data warehousing, 
where a central fact table (containing quantitative data) is connected to multiple
dimension tables (describing the context of the data). This structure simplifies analytical queries and accelerates 
information retrieval from databases.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your Maven `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.invirgance</groupId>
    <artifactId>convirgance-olap</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Scenario 
Suppose you are working on an online retail analytics and you have the following
star schema model with ORDERS as the central fact table, and PRODUCTS, 
SALESPERSONS, CUSTOMERS, and DAYS as dimensions:

The eventual goal of this exercise is to create SQL queries from OLAP structure.
Read along to better understand how Convirgance (OLAP) offers such functionality.




## Representing Database Structure


<!--
| Class          | Function                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Database`     | Database structure representation; contains table objects.                   |
| `Table`        | For Table object representation. Contains a primary key and list of foreign keys, which are columns shared between a source and target table.      |
| `ForeignKey`   | Captures the connection between a source table, a column on the source table, and a target table. |
| `SQLGenerator` | Support for creating and outputting SQL queries for working with OLAP.                   |

-->

You can use Convirgance (OLAP) to first capture the database structure with the five tables:

```java
Database stardb = new Database("StarDB");

Table orders = new Table("ORDERS", "order_id"); // "order_id" is the primary key for ORDERS table
Table products = new Table("PRODUCTS", "product_id");
Table salespersons = new Table("SALESPERSONS", "salesperson_id");
Table customers = new Table("CUSTOMERS", "customer_id");
Table days = new Table("DAYS", "day_id");

stardb.addTable(orders);
stardb.addTable(products);
stardb.addTable(salespersons);
stardb.addTable(customers);
stardb.addTable(days);
```

You can then capture the relationship between the ORDERS table and the rest of 
the tables by adding the foreign keys. The ORDERS table will
become the table following the `FROM` command in SQL queries.

``` java
orders.addForeignKey("product_id", products); 
orders.addForeignKey("salesperson_id", salespersons);
orders.addForeignKey("customer_id", customers);
orders.addForeignKey("day_id", days);
```

## Generating SQL Queries


Now that we have our database representation, we can use the SQLGenerator to 
output OLAP queries. Here is how it works:

<!-- 
table just represents that a table exists. 
an object in star schema. 
on top of that we put dimensions/metrics

todo: 
1. just say we create a structure for the star schema
2. once we have the structure, we can specify the dimensions and metrics
3. create a super simple star schema
    star diagram (e.g. 4 dimensions, 1 central table)

Explain with the example the schema, dimensions, facts (metrics)
Fact table at the centre is the table containing all the facts/metrics.
Only have a few records (4-10).
-->


This java code...

```java
SQLGenerator generator = new SQLGenerator();

generator.addTable(orders);
generator.addSelect("product_name", products);
generator.addSelect("salesperson_name", salespersons);
generator.addAggregate("sum", "cost_total", orders, "cost_dollars");

generator.getSQL(); // Get the SQL!
```
...generates the following SQL query:

```SQL
select
    PRODUCTS.product_name,
    SALESPERSONS.salesperson_name,
    sum(ORDERS.cost_dollars) as cost_total,
from ORDERS
join PRODUCTS on PRODUCTS.product_id = ORDERS.product_id
join SALESPERSONS on SALESPERSONS.salesperson_id = ORDERS.salesperson_id
group by
    PRODUCTS.product_name,
    SALESPERSONS.salesperson_name
```

1. Adding ORDERS table to the generator first sets it as the central fact table
and handles the joins between ORDERS and other tables.

2. The `addSelect(String Column, Table table)` method lets us specify which column to
select from table. It relies on previously specified primary and foreign keys to
handle the joins. 

3. The `addAggregate(String function, String column, Table table, String alias)` method
allows you to aggregate a metric from the central table into a measure. The first
parameter is a SQL function dictates the nature of 
aggregation. You can optionally specify the alias for the measure by passing
the fourth parameter to the method.


Using the `SQLGenerator` to generate SQL queries in this way is simple; yet, not ideal. 
The SQL Generator does not actually
capture the Dimensional analysis needed for OLAP. We want to explicitly define Dimensions,
Metrics, and Measures and let the user select them for interactive analysis. 

Luckily, Convirgance (OLAP) introduces that additional layer for OLAP Interface. Read on to see how it works.
<!--
1.  The `addSelect(String column, Table table)` lets us define a select from a table
2.  We capture this select in a `Column` inner class that represents the column and table
3.  We add the table to a list of tables we need to create joins between
4.  The addTable(Table table) method is public because OLAP queries are centered around a Fact table. The Fact table must be added first as the “From” table so that all joins fan out from it. Even if we never select any data from the Fact table itself.
5.  The getSQL() method loops through the select list to generate the columns to select and generates the first table in the list as the “from” table. It then calls generateJoins(from) and generateGroupBy().
<!-- TODO nit: 4 and 5 are a little on the long side 
6.  generateJoins(from) matches the ForeignKeys in the “from” table to tables in our list of selects and generates a join for each one
7.  generateGroupBy() loops through the selected columns again and generates a group by list of all columns that are not aggregates. i.e. They are dimension columns.

    - Wait… what are aggregates?

8.  Aggregates are the “fact” or “metric” columns that we want to roll up using a function like “sum()” or “avg()”
<!-- TODO nit 4, 5, 6, 8: use backticks when referring to the From table also with functions/objects table
9.  We can call `addAggregate(String function, String column, Table table)` to add the aggregate to our select list
10. We use an inner class called Aggregate to capture this select. Aggregate uses the inheritance pattern in OOP to “be” a Column while additionally capturing the function and overriding the getSQL() method.

    - Because our Aggregate “is” a Column, we don’t need to change any of our select logic or manage it separately.

## OLAP Interface

To bridge the database representation with an OLAP interface, we have Dimensions 
and Measures to work with as part of the Star Schema.

#### Defining Dimensions and Measures
Suppose we want to add the product name as one of the dimensions in our analysis,
and remember that we have the `products` table defined above. Further suppose
that the product names are contained in the `product_name`
column in the `products ` table. We can create a `Dimension` object to represent this dimension as follows:
```java
Dimension productName = new Dimension("Product Name", products, "product_name");
```
The first parameter passed to the constructor above is just what we want to name our
dimension. The second parameter is the table and the third is the column in the 
table from which we pull our dimensional information. 


Here is how we can define all Dimensions we might want to reference later
```java
Dimension productName = new Dimension("Product Name", products, "product_name"); 
Dimension salespersonName = new Dimension("Salesperson Name", salespersons, "salesperson_name");
// Dimension anotherDimension = new Dimension(<Dimension Name>, table, <column_name>);
// Repeat for any dimensions you want to define
```

It's a similar approach with Measures, which are aggregates over Metrics. We first
want to create a Metric object by specifying the table and the column that contains 
quantitative data. Suppose we want to look at the cost of an order. Remember we have
our `orders` table already defined, and suppose it contains the `cost_dollars` column.
We define the Metric as follows:
```java
Metric cost = new Metric(orders, "cost_dollars");
```
Now that we have the metric, we can define a measure over it, by specifying the 
Measure's name, the Metric object, and the SQL function that aggregates the metric.
Here is an example that creates a Measure for total cost:
```java
Measure costTotal = new Measure("Total", cost, "sum");
```
Of course, we can combine the creation of a Measure and Metric into a one-liner and 
similarly define all 
the measures we might want to reference later:
```java
Measure costTotal = new Measure("Total", new Metric(orders, "cost_dollars"), "sum");
// Measure anotherMeasure = new Measure(<name>, metric, <SQL function>);
// Repeat for any measures 
```

#### Defining a Star object to represent the Star Schema
Now that we have our Dimensions and Measures, we can add them to the star object to complete the schema:
Remember that the ORDERS table is at the center of our star schema. We thus want to construct
our star object as such:
```java
Star star = new Star(orders); // sets ORDERS table as the central fact table
```
Now we can add the dimensions and measures we defined above to our star object:
```java
star.addDimension(productName);
star.addDimension(salespersonName);
// Add any other dimensions

star.addMeasure(costTotal);
// Add any other measures
```

#### Creating a Report Generator to generate SQL
We now have the star object that reflects the star schema introduced at the beginning 
of this exercise. We can now generate the same SQL queries by specifying existing 
dimensions and measures to our `ReportGenerator` object:

```java
ReportGenerator generator = new ReportGenerator(star); // First need to assign the generator to the star schema.

// Dimensions and Metrics must come from the star object assigned to the generator.
generator.addDimension(star.getDimension("Product Name"));
generator.addDimension(star.getDimension("Salesperson Name"));
generator.addMeasure(star.getMeasure("Total"));

generator.getSQL(); // Generate the SQL!
```
That's it! Once we have the Star object, we can simply use the ReportGenerator
for our analytics. Of course, defining all these dimensions and measures for the star
can be tedious, but fortunately we can use the Spring Configuration file to quickly 
import our star. Move on to the next session to see an example.
<!--


| Class             | Function                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Dimension`       | Provides support for qualitative/contextual descriptions of data.            |
| `Measure`         | Provides support for aggregated quantitative values of data.                 |
| `Metric`          | Provides support for quantitative values of data.                            |
| `ReportGenerator` | Provides support for the SQL query generation from constructed star schemas. |
| `Star`            | Provides support for the central star schema.                                |

1. The `Star` plays the role of a central container, and it tracks the fact table at the center.
   Around the fact table are Dimensions. Inside the fact table are Metrics.
   Metrics will be aggregated in queries, so these are represented by Measures.

2. `Dimension` and `Metric` are simple, they simply contain a column
   name and a Table reference.

3. `Measure` also contains a column name, but no table. Instead, it wraps the
   associated with it Metric along with a function. The function is just the name of the
   SQL function we want to apple, such as "avg" or "sum".

4. Finally, the `ReportGenerator` allows to create queries within OLAP context.
   As an OLAP user, you no longer need to think about the underlying query structure. Instead,
   you simply specify Dimensions and Measures, and the OLAP layer takes care of the rest by pushing
   the the parameters down to the SQLGenerator.

  <!-- TODO nit: order list as items appear in the table or reoder the table -->

<!--
Here too, you can add the Star schema to the Spring configuration file just like we did with the Database above.
You can then lookup the Star from the configuration file and query immediately:

Here's how we can generate the same SQL Query as above by using the Star configured in Spring:

<!-- fill in the story with code actually constructing a star.
There is a test case that constructs a star that you can use. -->



<!--As a next step, you can use [Convirgance-WEB](https://github.com/InvirganceOpenSource/convirgance-web) to create web services around this OLAP
structure. -->



## Spring Method
Thanks to the inherent properties of Java Objects, we can just use a Spring configuration file to import our Star object.

<!-- TODO maybe add an example for this 

use the example above, create the spring config file based off that.

# Core Concepts and Goals

## Records


## Streams


## Transformations

Build data pipelines that clean and reshape your data. Convert types, group records, or compute new fields - all without loading everything into memory.


## Filters

Apply SQL-like conditions to any data source. Combine filters with AND/OR operations just like you would in a WHERE clause.

## Database Operations

Handle database interactions with confidence. Atomic operations ensure your transactions succeed or fail cleanly, while batch processing keeps things fast. Streamlining any interaction that you make with any database, all without the overhead from your typical ORM.

## Data Formats

Convirgance will handle reading and writing from, JSON, JBIN, CSV, Delimited (Pipe, Comma, ...). And, if support doesn't exist we have you covered with our easily extendible I/O interfaces.
